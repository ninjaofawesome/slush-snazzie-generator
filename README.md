# Snazzie Generator: A Dead Simple Static Site Generator

* * *

## What is this?

Snazzie is an easy to use static site generator that uses the powers of Gulp to allow for live development reloading, asset compilation and minification as well as deployment to github pages. Its pure front end goodness designed by a front end developer, for front end developers.

There are a couple of ways to set up a Snazzie website. [Manually](https://github.com/ninjaofawesome/snazzie) or with this generator.  The end result of either is the same, its a matter of preference as to which one you want to use.  For those less comfortable with changing remotes and working on the command line, this generator is a good option.

## How do I get started with this?

Getting started with Snazzie is easy to use in just a few simple steps.

1. Make sure that you have [Slush](http://slushjs.github.io/#/) and this generator installed globally on your system.
2. On the command line, create a directory for your new project and cd into it. (`mkdir [YOUR PROJECT NAME] && cd [YOUR PROJECT NAME]`).
3. Run `slush snazzie-generator` on the command line in your new repository and answer all the questions provided.
4. You will note that there will be an error after doing this on the command line, ignore it.  Once the generator has run, type in `npm i gulp gulp-template`.  This will solve that error.

That's it!

## OK great.  Now how do I use this?
